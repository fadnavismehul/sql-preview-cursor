# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Tab Naming Configuration**: Added `sqlPreview.tabNaming` setting to switch between `file-sequential` (Result 1, Result 2) and `query-snippet` naming.
- **Settings Organization**: Organized settings into transparent groups: Connection, Display, and Advanced (Beta).

### Fixed

- **Tab Naming**: Fixed issue where tabs would revert to query snippet naming during loading.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- Work around Porta returning "Empty query not supported" for valid SQL when using the Trino client. The extension now executes the first page via direct HTTPS POST to `/v1/statement` with Trino and Presto headers, then follows `nextUri` using HTTP GET. This mirrors clients like DataGrip and restores compatibility.
- Pagination: continue even when `columns` are not present in the first response (some clusters send columns on later pages).
- Export flow aligned to the same direct POST + pagination path for consistency.

### Added

- Probes to diagnose connectivity quickly:
  - `npm run probe` (multiple HTTP variants)
  - `npm run probe:extension` (matches extension path end-to-end)
- `.env.local` workflow (git-ignored) and `env.example` for credentials during local probes.
